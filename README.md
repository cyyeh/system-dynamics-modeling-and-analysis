# [System Dynamics Modeling and Analysis course from the University of Bergen](https://www.uib.no/en/utdanning/evu/150757/system-dynamics-modelling-and-analysis)

## Overview

- Chapter 1 is about systems thinking. Here you learn some systems insights that come out of System Dynamics studies. These systems thinking insights may serve as a motivation for the course. As you make progress in the course you will get a deeper understanding of these insights. You should move quickly through Chapter 1, as the course in System Dynamics (SD) really starts in Chapter 2.
- Chapter 2 is about problem oriented analysis and the logical steps of a SD study, which follows the steps of standard science.
- Chapters 3 to 7 teach model building and analysis in 5 steps, where each new step builds on the previous ones. 
- Chapter 8 summarizes the course with respect to model structure, behavior, method, and research philosophy. It points to further studies and gives practical information about the exam.
